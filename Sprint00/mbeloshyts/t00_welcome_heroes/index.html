        <p>
            A superhero is a person who does heroic deeds and has the ability to do them in a way that a normal person couldn’t.
            So in order to be a superhero, <b>you need a power that is more exceptional than any power a normal human being could possess</b>,
            and you need to use that power to accomplish good deeds.
            Otherwise, a policeman or a fireman could be considered a superhero.<br>
            For instance, a good guy fighting a bad guy could be just a regular police story or detective story or human-interest story.
            But if it’s a good guy with a superpower who is fighting a bad guy, it becomes a superhero story.
            If the good guy is doing something that a normal human being couldn’t do, couldn’t accomplish, then I assume he becomes a superhero.

            Iron Man is a superhero appearing in American comic books published by Marvel Comics.
            Co-created by writer and editor Stan Lee, developed by scripter Larry Lieber, and designed by artists Don Heck and Jack Kirby,
            the character first appeared in Tales of Suspense #39 in 1963, and received his own title with Iron Man #1 in 1968.

            Iron Man stories, individually and with the Avengers, have been published consistently since the character's creation.
